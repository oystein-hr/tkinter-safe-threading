"""
This recipe describes how to handle asynchronous I/O in an environment where
you are running Tkinter as the graphical user interface. Tkinter is safe
to use as long as all the graphics commands are handled in a single thread.
Since it is more efficient to make I/O channels to block and wait for something
to happen rather than poll at regular intervals, we want I/O to be handled
in separate threads. These can communicate in a threasafe way with the main,
GUI-oriented process through one or several queues. In this solution the GUI
still has to make a poll at a reasonable interval, to check if there is
something in the queue that needs processing. Other solutions are possible,
but they add a lot of complexity to the application.
